# Social Worker Case Review Search UI - Development Brief

## Project Overview
Create a web-based search interface for social workers to find relevant NSPCC case reviews for early intervention and risk mitigation. The system should provide comprehensive, actionable insights from historical case reviews to inform current child protection decisions.

## Core Functionality

### Search Input
- **Primary search box**: Natural language text input for social workers to describe their current case situation
- **Examples of input**: 

  **Example 1 - Detailed case note summary:**
  "Emma, age 6, living with mother (24) and mother's new partner (31) of 8 months. Historical DV with Emma's father who has supervised contact monthly. Mother reports new partner 'loses temper' with Emma, particularly around bedtime routines. Emma has started bedwetting again after being dry for 2 years, teachers report she's withdrawn at school and reluctant to go home. Mother admits feeling 'caught in the middle' and worried about losing housing if partner leaves. Previous social services involvement 18 months ago due to neglect concerns when mother was struggling with depression post-separation."

  **Example 2 - Multi-agency concern:**
  "Jake (14) and Mia (11), parents separated 6 months ago. Father moved out following police callout for DV. Mother struggling with alcohol use - GP concerned about morning drinking, children often late/absent from school. Grandmother providing some support but lives 40 minutes away. Jake displaying aggressive behavior at school, suspended twice this term. Mia appears to be taking on caring responsibilities - teacher notes she's often tired and talks about 'looking after mummy.' Housing association report arrears and complaints about noise/disturbances from neighbors."

  **Example 3 - Escalating risk scenario:**
  "Liam, 18 months old, brought to A&E by mother with bruising to torso. Mother (17) states he fell down stairs while playing. Partner (23) not present - mother says he's at work but becomes evasive when asked details. Previous presentations include: minor burn to hand at 8 months (attributed to touching radiator), failure to thrive concerns at 6 months. Health visitor notes mother appears anxious during visits, limited eye contact with Liam. Maternal grandmother expresses concerns about partner's 'short fuse' but mother denies any problems. Social housing - frequent noise complaints from neighbors about shouting."

  **Example 4 - Complex family dynamics:**
  "Sophie (13) and Ryan (9) in kinship care with paternal aunt following mother's imprisonment for drug offenses 8 months ago. Father whereabouts unknown. Sophie self-harming and refusing to engage with school support. Talks about wanting to 'rescue' mother and feels responsible for family breakdown. Ryan presenting as compliant but bed-wetting and having nightmares. Aunt struggling financially and emotionally - reports feeling 'out of her depth' with Sophie's behavior. Recent contact with imprisoned mother has led to Sophie becoming more distressed and making threats to run away to find her."

- **Empathetic** acknowledgment of case complexity
- **Clear warnings** about limitations and professional judgment requirements

### Information Prioritization
1. **Immediate safety concerns** - highest priority
2. **Intervention opportunities** - actionable next steps  
3. **Assessment considerations** - what to explore further
4. **Long-term risk factors** - ongoing monitoring needs
5. **System coordination** - multi-agency considerations

## Success Metrics
